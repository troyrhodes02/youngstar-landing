# Image Optimization Implementation

This document describes the image optimization strategy implemented in this project to improve loading performance.

## Problem

The website was experiencing slow image loading due to:
- Large image files (some up to 19MB)
- No image optimization techniques
- No responsive images
- No modern image formats

## Solution

### 1. Image Optimization Script

We've added a script to automatically optimize all images:

```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

This script:
- Creates optimized versions of all images in `/public/optimized/`
- Generates WebP versions for modern browsers (30-50% smaller file sizes)
- Reduces JPEG quality to 80% (good balance between quality and file size)
- Creates progressive JPEGs (appear to load faster)

### 2. Custom OptimizedImage Component

We've created a custom `OptimizedImage` component that:
- Automatically serves WebP to supporting browsers
- Falls back to optimized JPGs for older browsers
- Supports progressive loading (low-quality placeholder â†’ high-quality image)
- Properly handles loading states and errors

### 3. Next.js Configuration

We've updated `next.config.ts` to:
- Enable built-in Next.js image optimization
- Configure responsive image sizes
- Add WebP and AVIF support

## How to Use

1. **First, optimize your images:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run optimize-images
   ```

2. **Replace Image components:**
   ```jsx
   // Before
   <Image 
     src="/large-image.jpg" 
     alt="Description" 
     layout="fill" 
   />

   // After
   <OptimizedImage 
     src="/large-image.jpg" 
     alt="Description" 
     layout="fill" 
   />
   ```

3. **For critical above-the-fold images:**
   ```jsx
   <OptimizedImage 
     src="/hero-image.jpg" 
     alt="Hero" 
     priority={true}
     lazyLoad={false}
   />
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Always set proper `width` and `height` props to prevent layout shifts
2. Use appropriate `layout` prop based on context
3. Only set `priority` for above-the-fold images
4. Use proper `alt` text for accessibility
5. Keep original images in `/public` and optimized in `/public/optimized`
